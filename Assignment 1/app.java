 // I learned how to take user input in Java using a scanner. I also learned that Java is ten time more annoying then Python, and that I miss python. 
        // I also relearned how to reassign variables and was refreshed on all the different data types i.e. strings, integers, booleans, etc
        // Looking forward to a great semester!
