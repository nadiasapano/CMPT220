        /*
challenge file!
this one isn't too tough but it does require a little bit of writing and some googling
figure out how to take a string from the user
then print back out every individual letter one letter per line
I also am requiring a small write up: explain your discovery to me.
how did you figure out how to do this? can you translate your code into simple terms? 
you need to explain why you picked your for loop conditional and what's doing the work with the string
!!!!!!
Look into things like charAt- DO NOT NAME YOUR VARIABLE "REVERSED". If you do, automatic 0 points!!!!!!
!!!!!!!
if you're confused reach out!

        // Loop through each character in the string
        for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) { // loops as many times as there are letters in the string
            System.out.println(string.charAt(i)); // prints the character at position i and goes to the next line
        }
    }
}
// I used google to see if there was a specific function that I could use in order to index through charachers of a string
// First I created a scanner for the user to input a desired string to answer the question
// The input is then stored in variable named string 
// Next, I used a for loop, starting at i, ending at the length of the variable (number of characters)
// The loop increases 1 per character, once completed, the characters of the string are printed on separate lines, the desired result
